This little snippet comes handy to install the latest version of WordPress quickly from the terminal. Drop the function on your <code>/Username/.bash_profile</code> and then simply call <code>wp_install</code>  from the directory you want to install it.

Note: If you are not a TextMate owner, change the line:  
<code>mate wp-config.php</code>  
to  
<code>vi wp-config.php</code>
